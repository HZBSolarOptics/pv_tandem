pv_tandem is a python toolbox for simulation and energy yield calculations of single junction and tandem solar cells with classical (monofacial) or bifacial illumination.

* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://pv-tandem.readthedocs.io.

Features
--------

* Helping tools to process irradiance data for solar cell simulations
* Electrical modeling with 1-diode model for single junction or tandem solar cells
* Modeling of illumination in a large PV power plant for the front- and backside of the modules

Where to get it
---------------

pv_tandem can easily be installed with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pv_tandem

For more installation options see the `getting started <https://pv-tandem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>`_ section of the documentation. See the `example gallery <https://pv-tandem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_examples/index.html>`_ to see use cases of pv_tandem.
