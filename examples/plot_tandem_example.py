# This example shows how to model the spectral distribution of irradiance
# based on atmospheric conditions. The spectral distribution of irradiance is
# the power content at each wavelength band in the solar spectrum and is
# affected by various scattering and absorption mechanisms in the atmosphere.
# This example recreates an example figure from the SPECTRL2 NREL Technical
# Report [1]_. The figure shows modeled spectra at hourly intervals across
# a single morning.

# The SPECTRL2 model has several inputs; some can be calculated with pvlib,
# but other must come from a weather dataset. In this case, these weather
# parameters are example assumptions taken from the technical report.

# the technical report; this is because airmass is estimated from solar
# position and the solar position calculation in the technical report does not
# exactly match the one used here.  However, the differences are minor enough
# to not materially change the spectra.
